Arabian Camels is a collection of 12,012 uniquely generated digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain that dropped in May 2021. In addition to rolling out an international merch and brand strategy, the camels are now launching 'The Antara Movie NFT' (aka Arabian Camels 2.0) This is a circa $45M NFT drop which will fund the Antara movie, where NFT holders will own up to 50% of the IP rights of the film/box office. This is set to make Antara the first movie in history funded by an NFT, and the Arabian Camels the first NFT community to produce a movie together.</p>
