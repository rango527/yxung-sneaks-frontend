                        <br />
                        Please read this section carefully. This section affects
                        rights that you may otherwise have. It provides for
                        resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead
                        of court trials and class actions.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A
                        COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
                        ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM.
                        OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT,
                        SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR
                        LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Any controversy or claim between you and Madeium arising
                        out of or relating to: (a) this Agreement, or the breach
                        thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the Site or
                        Membership Services, or (c) any alleged violation of any
                        federal or state or local law, statute or ordinance
                        (each such controversy or claim, a “<b>Claim</b>”), shall be
                        resolved exclusively by a binding arbitration
                        administered by the American Arbitration Association in
                        accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, with
                        the arbitration to be held in Multnomah County, State of
                        Oregon, USA. You hereby consent to the exclusive
                        jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in
                        Multnomah County, Oregon, USA to enforce this Agreement.
                        However, judgment on the award rendered by the
                        arbitrator may be entered in any court having
                        jurisdiction thereof. Claims shall be heard by a single
                        arbitrator. Arbitrations shall be held in Multnomah
                        County, Oregon but the parties may choose for themselves
                        whether to appear in person, by phone, or through the
                        submission of documents. The arbitration shall be
                        governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and by the
                        internal laws of the State of Oregon, without regard to
                        conflicts of laws principles. The prevailing party shall
                        be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees.
                        In arbitration, the parties give up their right to have
                        their Claim decided by a judge or jury, and their Claim
                        is instead decided by an arbitrator. Discovery rights
                        and appellate rights in arbitration are more limited
                        than in court. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned
                        award in writing, including all findings of fact and law
                        upon which the award was made.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        YOU AND MADEIUM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING OR PARTICIPATE
                        IN CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE
                        INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
                        MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR
                        REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND MADEIUM
                        AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
                        CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR
                        PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED, AND MAY NOT
                        OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR
                        CLASS PROCEEDING. IF A CLAIM IMPLICATES THIS SECTION,
                        AND IF THIS SECTION IS FOUND TO BE INVALID,
                        UNENFORCEABLE OR ILLEGAL BY A COURT OF COMPETENT
                        JURISDICTION, THEN SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A
                        COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR. NOTWITHSTANDING THE
                        FOREGOING, IF ANY CLAIM IS NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION,
                        YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND
                        EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF,

                        You may not assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without prior written consent from Madeium. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect. Madeium’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of that provision or any other provision of these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to accomplish, as nearly as possible, the objective thereof, or shall be severed from the document if, and solely, to the limited extent such construction is not possible, and the remaining portion of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms may be executed by the parties in one or more counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original and such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Madeium as a result of these Terms or your use of the Site or Membership Services.
